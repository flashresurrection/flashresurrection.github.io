## Introduction

Adobe Flash was once a popular platform for creating and playing web-based games and animations. However, due to security concerns and the rise of modern web technologies, Flash support has been phased out by major web browsers.

Ruffle is a project aimed at preserving Flash content by providing a Flash Player emulator written in Rust. This allows you to run Flash games directly in your web browser without relying on outdated Flash plugins.

This GitHub project aims to demonstrate how to use Ruffle to play Flash games. It provides a sample game and instructions on how to run it using Ruffle.
